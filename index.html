                In an effort to make her house party for the Orchestra a little bit more appealing, my college roommate (and now bridesmaid!) Dana, decided to extend the invitation to friends & other people we knew. Because yes, you're right, an Orchestra party doesn't sound all that poppin'. <i>(Dana who built this website, is greatly offended by this sentence).</i>
                <br>
                <br>
                So call it what you want - serendipity, fate, or a Colorado guy on the hunt for some smart ladies - but Mike ended up at that party in my college apartment. He had on a GIANT flannel shirt, some crusty Nikes, and hair to his shoulders. But despite all that, he was tall, super handsome, and brought his own beer... a man after my own heart.
                <br>
                <br>
                We talked about the Knicks, fantasy football, played beer pong, and I even stupidly challenged him to a chugging contest, which I lost. We left the party, stumbled over to 1020 (a local bar), and flirted some more. We exchanged numbers, texted regularly, and by the following week I was visiting his place in Brooklyn and meeting his dog.
                <br>
                <br>
                We were spending every weekend together, and he eventually said those five magic words a girl always hopes to hear from her man: "I need to go shopping." By that point, we were inseparable, and still are. As our story evolves and moves from one Manhattan apartment to another, with our dog J in toe, I have to say that I've never been more grateful for being at the right place at the right time, and meeting Mike the day we did and the way we did.
                <br>
                <br>
                We're so fortunate to have all of you as part of our story one way or another, and can't wait to celebrate and drink up at the party of all parties, OUR WEDDING!
